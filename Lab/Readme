There is 4 images that are built and ran. 2 Victim machines, a vulnerable web application and a hacker machine which has access into Kali linux repositories.

To spin up the instances make sure you have installed docker-machine;
You can install docker machine by doing;

1) curl -L https://github.com/docker/machine/releases/download/v0.16.0/docker-machine-`uname -s`-`uname -m` >/tmp/docker-machine &&
2) chmod +x /tmp/docker-machine &&
3) sudo cp /tmp/docker-machine /usr/local/bin/docker-machine

Once docker machine is installed, make sure you are running the latest docker; I ran this under; Version: 17.05.0-ce; API version: 1.29; Go version: go1.7.5; without any problems.

I will update this and make it better but its just a rough draft right now.
1) Run ./Start-Env.sh as root
Start-Env.sh will build all the images and create the network; and then spin up the images into a container; They should be removed each time Start-Env.sh is ran, and you should have a disposable docker enviroment to run this lab in.
2) docker ps -a
3) docker exec -it s1-h1 /bin/bash (Make sure s1-h1 is the container ID for s1-h1
4) Scripts to enumerate the network are in /root/python

You can execute them as such;

python3 get_arps.py -t 172.18.0.0/16 -i eth0

Example to Spoof a machine; python3 arp_spoof.py (Will fill this out later)
